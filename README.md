# Ubuntu Touch Programming Course

Ubuntu Touch is a version of Ubuntu that runs on mobile devices. It can be found in phones and tablets. Although it is growing and improving little by little has a lack of applications compared to other platforms. One way to address this problem is by writing documentation to facilitate the task. For this purpose I started the course in August 2016.

The course is currently in Spanish and English. The version in Spanish was the initial version so it has more content published. For its part, the English version begins in February 2017. In April 2017 [Canonical announced that it was leaving Ubuntu Touch](https://insights.ubuntu.com/2017/04/05/growing-ubuntu-for-cloud-and-iot-rather-than-phone-and-convergence/). The project was continued by [UBports](https://ubports.com/).
